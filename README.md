# QSearch
Amount of data is exponentially increasing and with this the amount of useless information is also increasing. There is an immediate need for computers to be able to handle such vast amounts of data and be able to find the relevant piece of information. The current linear search algorithms require about O(N) steps in order to find the relevant pieces of information containing N data sets. But, with the use of quantum computers and a little modification to groverâ€™s search algorithm we can reduce the time to O(sqrt(N)) the only other time which is required is in the original state preparation, even after that there is a huge difference in time consumed.
